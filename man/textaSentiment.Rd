\title{Assesses the sentiment of sentences or documents.}
\usage{
textaSentiment(documents, languages = rep("en", length(documents)))
}
\arguments{
\item{documents}{(character vector) Vector of sentences or documents for
which to assess sentiment.}

\item{languages}{(character vector) Languages of the sentences or documents,
supported values: "en"(English, default), "es"(Spanish), "fr"(French),
"pt"(Portuguese)}
}
\value{
An S3 object of the class \code{\link{texta}}. The results are stored
in the \code{results} dataframe inside this object. The dataframe contains
the original sentences or documents and their sentiment score. If an error
occurred during processing, the dataframe will also have an \code{error}
column that describes the error.
}
\description{
This function returns a numeric score between 0 and 1 with
scores close to 1 indicating positive sentiment and scores close to 0
indicating negative sentiment.

Sentiment score is generated using classification techniques. The input
features of the classifier include n-grams, features generated from
part-of-speech tags, and word embeddings. English, French, Spanish and
Portuguese text are supported.

Internally, this function invokes the Microsoft Cognitive Services Text
Analytics REST API documented at \url{https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/text-analytics/documentation}.

You MUST have a valid Microsoft Cognitive Services account and an API key for
this function to work properly. See \url{https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/pricing}
for details.
